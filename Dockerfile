# Mail-in-a-Box Dockerfile
###########################
#
# This file lets Mail-in-a-Box run inside of Docker (https://docker.io),
# a virtualization/containerization manager.
#
# Run:
#   $ containers/docker/run.sh
# to build the image, launch a storage container, and launch a Mail-in-a-Box
# container.

# We need a better starting image than docker's ubuntu image because that
# base image doesn't provide enough to run most Ubuntu services. See
# http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/ for an explanation.

# Docker has a beautiful way to cache images after each step. The next few
# steps of installing system packages are very intensive, so we take care
# of them early and let docker cache the image after that, before doing
# any Mail-in-a-Box specific system configuration. That makes rebuilds
# of the image extremely fast.
